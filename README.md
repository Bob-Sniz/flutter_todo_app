# flutter_todo_app

A new Flutter project.
I am learning how to do Flutter projects and I have done so with great help online.
I acknowledge **mitchkoko** for the youtube video that I have used to create the project. **(ðŸ“± TO DO App â€¢ Flutter Tutorial â™¥ Hive Local Storage)** Here is the link: **(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMgr47QBZWA&pp=ygUnZmx1dHRlciB0dXRvcmlhbCB3aXRoIHByb2plY3RzIHRvZG8gYXBw)**
All learners should pay a visit to it too.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:
